## What Was Built

An AI-powered system that automatically analyzes exam questions and tags them with relevant syllabus chapters, creating a comprehensive question bank organized by topic.

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Migration
- `supabase/migrations/20251020000001_add_question_chapter_tagging.sql`
  - Creates `question_chapter_tags` table (junction table)
  - Adds `syllabus_id` to `exam_questions` table
  - Creates `question_with_chapters` view
  - Sets up RLS policies
  - Creates indexes for performance

### Edge Function (Updated)
- `supabase/functions/process-exam-paper/index.ts`
  - Added `tagQuestionsWithChapters()` function
  - Fetches matching syllabus for exam paper
  - Sends questions + chapters to Gemini AI
  - Saves chapter tags to database
  - Tracks token usage for tagging

### UI Components
- **New:** `src/components/QuestionBankByChapter.tsx`
  - Filter by subject and grade level
  - View chapters with question counts
  - Expand chapters to see tagged questions
  - Display confidence scores and AI reasoning
  - Show question images and text

- **Updated:** `src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx`
  - Added "Question Bank" tab
  - Integrated QuestionBankByChapter component

## How It Works

### Workflow

```
1. Admin uploads exam paper (Subject: Math, Grade: 10)
   ↓
2. AI extracts questions (existing feature)
   ↓
3. System finds matching syllabus
   - Query: syllabus for Math + Grade 10
   - Gets all chapters from that syllabus
   ↓
4. AI analyzes questions against chapters
   - Sends question text + chapter info to Gemini
   - AI matches each question to relevant chapter(s)
   - Returns confidence scores (0-100%)
   ↓
5. Tags saved to database
   - question_chapter_tags table
   - Links questions to chapters
   ↓
6. View in Question Bank
   - Filter by subject/grade
   - Browse questions by chapter
```

### AI Analysis

**Input to AI:**
```
CHAPTERS:
- Chapter 1: Algebra Basics
  Description: Introduction to algebraic expressions
  Subtopics: Variables, constants, expressions

- Chapter 2: Linear Equations
  Description: Solving linear equations
  Subtopics: One-variable equations, two-variable equations

QUESTIONS:
- Question 1: Solve for x: 2x + 5 = 13
- Question 2: Simplify: 3a + 2b - a + 4b
```

**Output from AI:**
```json
[
  {
    "questionNumber": "1",
    "matches": [
      {
        "chapterId": "chapter-2-uuid",
        "chapterNumber": 2,
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "isPrimary": true,
        "reasoning": "Question asks to solve a linear equation in one variable"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "questionNumber": "2",
    "matches": [
      {
        "chapterId": "chapter-1-uuid",
        "chapterNumber": 1,
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "isPrimary": true,
        "reasoning": "Question involves simplifying algebraic expressions"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Database Schema

### question_chapter_tags
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- question_id (uuid) → exam_questions.id
- chapter_id (uuid) → syllabus_chapters.id
- confidence_score (numeric 0.00-1.00)
- is_primary (boolean) - main chapter for this question
- match_reasoning (text) - AI's explanation
- is_manually_set (boolean) - for manual overrides
- created_at, updated_at
```

### exam_questions (enhanced)
```sql
+ syllabus_id (uuid) → syllabus.id [NEW]
  (for quick reference to which syllabus was used)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Tagging
- ✅ Runs automatically when exam paper is uploaded
- ✅ Only runs if matching syllabus exists
- ✅ Gracefully skips if no syllabus available
- ✅ Logs all activity for debugging

### 2. Multi-Chapter Support
- ✅ Questions can match multiple chapters
- ✅ One chapter marked as "primary"
- ✅ Confidence scores for each match
- ✅ Only saves matches with confidence ≥ 60%

### 3. Question Bank UI
- ✅ Filter by subject and grade
- ✅ View chapters with question counts
- ✅ Expand to see all questions in a chapter
- ✅ Display confidence scores
- ✅ Show AI reasoning
- ✅ View question images

### 4. Cost-Effective
- ✅ Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash (cheapest model)
- ✅ Text-only analysis (no images)
- ✅ Typical cost: $0.0002 - $0.0005 per exam
- ✅ Token usage logged to database

- Total: ~3,000 tokens
- Cost: ~$0.0004

**Large exam with 50 questions, 15 chapters:**
- Input: ~8,000 tokens
- Output: ~2,000 tokens
- Total: ~10,000 tokens
