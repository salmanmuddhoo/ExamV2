-- FIX: Reset subjects trigger was clearing grade/subject selections during purchase
-- The trigger was running BEFORE UPDATE and clearing values when tier changed
-- This prevented handle_successful_payment from setting grade/subjects during purchase

-- Original bug flow:
-- 1. handle_successful_payment sets tier_id + selected_grade_id + selected_subject_ids
-- 2. reset_subjects_on_tier_change runs (BEFORE UPDATE)
-- 3. Detects tier change, clears selected_grade_id and selected_subject_ids â†’ NULL
-- 4. UPDATE completes with NULL values (data lost!)

COMMENT ON FUNCTION reset_subjects_on_tier_change IS
'Clears subject selections when tier changes (upgrades/downgrades).
IMPORTANT: Only clears if selections are NOT being set in the same UPDATE.
This allows handle_successful_payment to set grade/subjects during purchase without interference.';
