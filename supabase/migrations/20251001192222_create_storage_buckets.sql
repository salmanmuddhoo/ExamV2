  # Create Storage Buckets for PDFs

  ## Overview
  This migration creates storage buckets for exam papers and marking schemes,
  along with appropriate access policies.

  ## Storage Buckets
  1. `exam-papers` - Stores exam paper PDFs (public read access)
  2. `marking-schemes` - Stores marking scheme PDFs (public read access)

  ## Security
  - Public read access for all users (anonymous and authenticated)
  - Admin-only write/upload access
  - Admin-only delete access
